# AdLister Project README

Welcome to the AdLister project! This project is an opportunity to collaboratively develop a full stack application up 
to a given specification.

This repository includes a Kanban-style task board using GitHub Projects. At a minimum, your team should complete all
the cards in the TODO column. If you have extra class time to develop additional features, the Nice-to-Have cards 
provides many feature suggestions to implement.

## Setup (each team member)

1. Clone this repository
2. Add the project as a Maven Project
3. Setup Tomcat
4. Create a `Config` class based on the provided `ExampleConfig` code
5. Create a database for your project (the migration file expects it to be called `adlister_db` but this can be changed)
6. Run the migration (change the database in the `use` query, if changed)

## Project Management Expectations

Each team will have the flexibility to determine how cards/tasks are divided between team members. Paired programming
can be used as an effective strategy to speed up development of especially challenging features/tasks. It is recommended
that all team members take on cards that involve development in each part of the MVC architecture. Keep your Project 
Board updated and communicate early and often with your teammates.
